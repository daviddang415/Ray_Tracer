# Ray Tracer

Ray Tracer is a program that simulates the physical behavior of light emissions on objects in a 3D world. It creates a large number of rays that each has an initial position and velocity. The program then performs collision detection to determine if a ray intersects with an object. By transforming the rays using matrix multiplication, we can recreate many real-world optical effects on the objects, such as shadows, reflection, and transparency.
